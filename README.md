# Homework-2
This is my homework 

This was a challenge for sure, ended up getting done what I could. A lot is broken regarding scaling down to the 640px size. code is there but couldn't get the nav bar to getunder my name, or the images to stack when shrinking down to this size. 

for some reason my white background behind the couldn't work either, code is on the portfolio page css for that. 

also highlighted area's of code that I tried and weren't working in the css. 

overall gave it my best shot and but a lot of time into, hopefully it's not to horrible lol. 

this will have a contact, about me, and a portfolio html file and the same with the css files.
